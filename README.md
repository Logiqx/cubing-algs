# cubing-algs

Quite some time back, I built a reactive website for my cubing algs, mainly for personal use but also to share with friends.

It’s by no means a replacement for AlgDB but it's probably useful to other cubers due to some of the features that it provides.

<u>Features</u>

- Includes 2H and OH algs for intermediate and advanced sets
  - Displays 2H + OH horizontally (i.e. two columns) on tablets and desktop computers
  - Displays 2H + OH vertically on smart phones and small tablets
- Multiple views for larger sets
  - e.g. OLLs can be ordered by shape, corner orientation, edge orientation, case number, etc.
  - Provides a "grid" view which is handy for larger sets such as OLL or PLL recognition
- Individual case views – just click / tap on the case
  - Lists multiple algorithms for each case – including 2H and OH
  - Explanations and decompositions of algs – general structure, combos, cancellations, etc.
  - Links to the SpeedSolving Wiki and AlgDB.net
- Additional information
  - Includes general thoughts / comments about individual cases and groups of cases
  - Includes the probabilities of every case in every set
- Popular alg sets for beginner, intermediate and advanced solvers
  - Beginner / Improver – i.e. learning minimal / easy algorithms
  - Intermediate – 2-look variations (e.g. 2LOLL + 2LPLL, 2LCLL + 2LELL, etc)
  - Advanced – Full OLL, PLL, COLL, etc.
  - Expert – Nothing yet
- Responsive web design
  - Mobile first – works well on smart phones and installable as a web app on Android
  - Layout will change to the best possible view when rotating your mobile device

<u>Known bugs</u>

- The responsive menu misbehaves on some mobile devices. It used to work fine!

Feel free to let me know what you think of the website and please let me know if you encounter any bugs or mistakes.
